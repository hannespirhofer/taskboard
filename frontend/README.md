# JOIN - The Friendly Todo Board
Welcome to JOIN! This is a fun, easy-to-use todo board that we built together as a group project. It's all about keeping track of tasks, but with a cool, Kanban-style twist. Think of it like your personal Trello, but made with simple, straightforward JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## What You Can Do

***Make it Yours***: Give each task a priority level, so you know what to tackle first.
***Keep an Eye on the Clock***: Add deadlines to your tasks and watch the time.
***Details, Details***: Don't miss out on anything with the option to add detailed descriptions to your tasks.
***Move it Around***: Enjoy dragging and dropping your tasks across different stages like Todo, In Progress, Await Feedback, and Done – just like moving game pieces on a board!

## Behind the Scenes
There's a nifty little API backend that keeps everything running smoothly. It's like the engine of our todo board, making sure your tasks are always up to date and where they need to be.

## Team Spirit
Since this was a group project, we designed JOIN to be super collaborative. It's perfect for teams who want to stay on the same page and have a bit of fun managing their work.

## Jump Right In
Getting started is easy-peasy. Grab the code, fire up the backend, and you're ready to roll. No complicated setups here – we're all about keeping it chill and user-friendly.

## Join In
Got ideas? Cool! We love to see new contributions and fun tweaks. Feel free to dive in and play around with the code or add something awesome.

## Just So You Know
JOIN is totally open source, so you can tweak, share, and enjoy it however you like. Dive in and make it your own!

So, what are you waiting for? Come join us and make task management a little more fun and a lot less daunting!
